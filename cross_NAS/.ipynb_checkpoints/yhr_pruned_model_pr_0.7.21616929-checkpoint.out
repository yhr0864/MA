Threshold should be less than 0.1267.
The corresponding prune ratio limit is 0.852.
Channels with Gamma value less than 0.066687 are pruned!
mAP of the origin model is 0.82181
Number of channels has been reduced from 3104 to 930
Prune ratio in theory: 0.700 (setup manually!)
mAP of the pseudo-pruned model is 0.4723
